I'm like a fire
You light me up when u need me 
And when I die 
I leave marks all around

I have a huge weakness
But always recover 

You can't get to far from me 
Or else you will freeze 
But you can't get to close,
For you will get hurt...
Keep your distance 
But don't let me die

If i go down 
You go down with me 
And at the dark of night 
I attract all
I'm the one who helps 
I'm the key ressource 

In the light of day 
When all is well
I'm not needed
I'm ignored 

So what is it about me 
That sends so many mixed signals 

Is it my red hot temper 
Mixed with a relaxing wave of heat
Or maybe 
The fact that I'm fragile 
Mixed with a demanding power 

In other words 
I'm so emotional 
Yet 
Come out as a scary big bad wolf 

Honestly 
I think the reason why 
Is because I'm capable of being great
And others would rather I stay 
Normal
Average

So they balance it out 
They use me...
I don't want to be used

So I'll just spread my flame 
I am a fire after all
I'll get so close to everyone 
They will have to fight back 
Or else they will get hurt 
And when they fight back 
I'll die 
But they will go down with me

I'm the fire 
Only I can be lit again...


I'm like a fire 
You light me up when you need me
So you shouldn't expect me in the light 
When all is going well 
I'm just hiding 
Not knowing what to do 
I'm of no power 
Right?  

Foolish little human :)
